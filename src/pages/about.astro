        Like many others, in my freetime I've got some hobbies that help me to enjoy life with family or get some
        relaxing alone time.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-white">
        <strong>Playing Games.</strong> Of course videos games but not always. Losing yourself in a board game with my
        family is by far the best of the best.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-white">
        <strong>Making beer.</strong> A relatively new hobbie that I recently started is learning how to properly make
        beer. It's such a pretty relaxing thing to do where it has become a personal goal to open up a micro brewery. So
        far I have brewed around 20 different batches of beer, some turned out very good but there were many
        failures...aka, the learning process.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-white">
        <strong>House work.</strong> That's right I actually enjoy knocking out honey do lists with some home
        improvements. Some home improvements I am proud of would be the completion of our unfinished downstairs. Which
        was all designed and built out by myself...it was ALOT of work. Also, the building of a shed outside and
        wrapping a fence around our backyard.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-white">
        <strong>Music.</strong> Whether I'm listening or playing it, music will always have that special place in my
        heart.
